A PID controller continuously calculates an error value  as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively). In practical terms it automatically applies accurate and responsive correction to a control function, so it restores the measured speed to the desired speed with minimal delay and overshoot, by increasing the power output of the engine.
